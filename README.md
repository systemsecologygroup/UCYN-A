# UCYN-A
Files related to the paper 'Nitrogen fixation mechanisms and distribution patterns of UCYN-A in the global ocean'

# Description of files
The folder 'UCYN-A_GitHub' contains different files.

(1) Matlab codes to generate Fig. 3 from the paper 'Nitrogen fixation mechanisms and distribution patterns of UCYN-A in the global ocean'. The provided code will help to generate the variation in N2 fixation rate by UCYN-A at different light intensities.

(2) xlsx files for the experimental data used in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.


# How to run the code
To generate Fig. 3 requires three scripts in the 'UCYN-A_GitHub' folder, the 'UCYNA_Vary_Light.m', the 'UCYNA_Vary_Light_Size.m', and the 'Plot_Nfix.m'. 

(1) First we need to run 'UCYNA_Vary_Light.m' to get the N2 fixation rate at different light intensities.

(2) To obtain the range of variations in N2 fixation rate at different light intensities, run 'UCYNA_Vary_Light_Size.m'.

(3) Then run 'Plot_Nfix.m' to generate the plot.

We also need 'viscocity_temperature_Jumars_1993.csv' file to run (1) and (2).
