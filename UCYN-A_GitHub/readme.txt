Description of matlab files for Fig. 3a


1. To obtain Fig 3a, first run UCYNA_Vary_Light.m to get the N2 fixation rate at different light intensities. This will also generate a light vs N2 fixation rate plot.

2. To obtain the range of variations in N2 fixation rate at different light intensities, run UCYNA_Vary_Light_Size.m

3. Then run Plot_Nfix.m to generate the final plot.
